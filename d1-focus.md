## Responses

### 1. What do researchers want to know about their own data? 

* Who’s using it
  * Their name, credentials, contact info
  * What other data is the person using your data downloading? 
  * What data does the person using your data have in the system?
* How exactly they are using it - purpose
  * Are they going to publish something based on it?  
  * Do they have a project that makes use of the data? 
  * Are they using it in research? teaching? in government/decision making?
  * Using all of it or subsets?
  * Combining with other datasets?
  * Is it being used by an organization trying to promote bad science? (i.e., inappropriately) 
* If a paper was published using the data
* If someone is selling your data
* Where a dataset was downloaded from - there might be other copies; ideally they would have the same identifier but they may not. 
* Are the same people citing datasets and papers? 

### 2. What do researchers want to know about other people’s data?

* Are there big gaps/missing data
* if others downloaded it, did they think it was good?
* links to publications associated with the data
  * has a publication come from the data?
  * publications that cite the dataset
* data quality
  * quality assurance records
  * scripts for quality
* restrictions on its use
* who do I know that has used the dataset?
* how often has it been downloaded? by whom? people I trust?

### 3. Which metrics are most useful for judging impact? Quality?

* publications
  * how many publications has it led to 
  * how many immediately associated with the dataset
  * how many pubs have been derived from the dataset
  * pubs by people who own the data versus pubs from other people (self-citation)
  * quality of publications
* data use
  * number of downloads and on what time scale
  * how many different disciplines have used the dataset
  * use in education (downloads in a short period of time from one institution = educational use. esp. when tracked to .edu addresses)
  * used in decision-making 
* has the dataset been peer-reviewed (quality)
  * effort that went into peer review can indicate impact
  * Ted Haberman - quality rubriques for data/metadata. if it’s gone through something like that, it’s a good * indication of quality
* reproducibility. has it been reproduced? has someone documented a reproduction of the dataset?
* does it lead to legislation, land management, policy etc.
* who funded the data collection

### 4. What do repositories want to know about the data they hold? 

* its impact
* whether there are any security issues
* usage
  * downloads, page visits
  * knowing what community is downloading the data
  * usage in primary literature
  * usage outside of literature in science
  * usage in education
* where was data cited (hard reference) versus where was it referred to (softer indication)
* how many times people are depositing data into a repository
* number of datasets
* number of people depositing dataset
* click streams within sessions - how they are navigating through the system
* relationships among datasets - cousins; derived; etc. would be great to have a visual of this
* relationships between dataset usage. links between things and how they propagate. publications back to dataset back to people etc.


### 5. What repository decisions might be informed by that information? 

* when data isn’t being used, why not? 
* return on investment of developing a repository
* deaccession (Varies depending on repository’s mission)
* ability to get outside funding 
* developing our own cost models internally for charging users for data/service
* ability to present views of the repo that are more customized for the user. user pages that describe how the data are used
* collection development decisions
* scope repository submissions to limit what is taken in in the future
* define service tiers
* define priorities
* university-level impact of data

### 6. What metrics are repositories already looking at? 

* related publications
* publication citation counts
* usage stats - downloads

### 7. What privacy issues are repositories concerned about?

* European privacy laws / international privacy laws
* violation of HIPPA laws
* other organizations sucking up data out of repository (e.g., running mirrors of the ORNL DAAC in China. ORNL doesn’t get the download counts.


### 8. For each potential metric, what sources we should draw from? 

* textbooks for educational use
* primary literature, publications
* assessments that reference multiple datasets
* national assessments
* google searches for links to a dataset. will show up in a syllabus for example
* download stats from repositories; feeds from IRs
* funding bodies
* Data citation index


### 9. What other projects should we know about? 

* TR data citation index 
* RDA working groups - one on article/data connection
* Impact Story
* Figshare
* Elsevier - has a data something program with a web page asking for contributions to what metrics they should want. emdp.elseiver 
* Think-Up - impact of social media. commercial endeavour.

### 10. Who are the stakeholders?

* Researchers
* data repositories
* librarians
* funders
* policy makers
* university administrators
* office of research
* publishers 
* federal agencies - what’s most trustworthy data?
