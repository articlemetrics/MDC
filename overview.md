## Purpose

We propose to design and develop metrics that track and measure data use, “data-level metrics” (DLM). DLM are a multi-dimensional suite of indicators, measuring the broad range of activity surrounding the reach and use of data as a research output. We will investigate the validity and feasibility of the metrics by collecting them and investigating how to best make use of the data harvested to power discovery and reporting of scholarly these scholarly outputs.  

## High-level Project Summary

1. design, develop, and prototype a reference model for data metrics
1. test mechanisms of automatic tracking
1. explore ways in which the raw DLM data be delivered to drive data discovery across data types and research questions
1. prototype a flexible report for funders, institutions, and researchers to share DLM results.  

## Work Components

  * Output: metrics design & requirements

### Data Usage Tracking (Nov-Feb)

  * What: Extend DataONE usage tracking capacity 
  * Who: DataONE with PLOS input
  * Input: existing usage API
  * Output: extended usage API (COUNTER)
 
### Data Activity Aggregation (Dec-Apr)

  * What: Formulate a set of metrics to text; extend technology
  * Who: PLOS
  * Input: design & requirements
  * Output: DLM application
 
### DLM Integration & Presentation (May-Jun)

  * What:  Develop tools for the community to use metrics
  * Who: PLOS
