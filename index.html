We are excited to announce that <a href="http://cdlib.org/services/uc3">UC3</a>, in partnership with <a href="http://plos.org">PLOS</a> and <a href="http://dataone.org">DataONE</a>, are launching a <strong>new project to develop data-level metrics (DLMs)</strong>. This 12-month project is funded by an Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant from the <a href="http://nsf.gov" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a>, and will result in a suite of metrics that track and measure data use. The <b>proposal is available</b> via CDL's <a href="http://escholarship.org" target="_blank">eScholarship</a> repository: <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9kf081vf">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9kf081vf</a>. More information is also available on the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1448821&amp;HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">NSF Website</a>.
<br><br>
<strong>Why DLMs?</strong> Sharing data is time consuming and researchers need incentives for undertaking the extra work. Metrics for data will provide feedback on data usage, views, and impact that will help encourage researchers to share their data. This project will explore and test the metrics needed to capture activity surrounding research data.
<br><br>
The DLM pilot will build from the successful open source Article-Level Metrics community project, <a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto">Lagotto</a>, originally started by PLOS in 2009. ALM provide a view into the activity surrounding an article after publication, across a broad spectrum of ways in which research is disseminated and used (e.g., viewed, shared, discussed, cited, and recommended, etc.)
<h2><strong>About the project partners</strong></h2>

<a href="http://plos.org" target="_blank">PLOS</a> (Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit publisher and advocacy organization founded to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication.
<br><br>
<a href="http://dataone.org" target="_blank">Data Observation Network for Earth</a> (DataONE) is an NSF <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datanet" target="_blank">DataNet</a> project which is developing a distributed framework and sustainable cyberinfrastructure that meets the needs of science and society for open, persistent, robust, and secure access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data.
<br><br>
The <a href="http://cdlib.org/services/uc3" target="_blank">University of California Curation Center</a> (UC3) at the <a href="http://cdlib.org" target="_blank">California Digital Library</a> is a creative partnership bringing together the expertise and resources of the <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu" target="_blank">University of California</a>. Together with the UC libraries, we provide high quality and cost-effective solutions that enable campus constituencies – museums, libraries, archives, academic departments, research units and individual researchers – to have direct control over the management, curation and preservation of the information resources underpinning their scholarly activities.
