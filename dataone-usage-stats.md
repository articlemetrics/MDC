title: DataONE Usage statistics for MDC
permalink: /dataone-usage-stats/
---

The MDC project will utilize the [DataONE](http://www.dataone.org) federation of data repositories as a source for data usage statistics.  DataONE federates a large collection of data sets across a couple of dozen data repositories and provides a common metadata index across these.  In addition, DataONE federates usage statistics for all of these repositories, making it easy to calculate total downloads for any object across the whole federation.  These design notes provide some background in how to use the various DataONE APIs to access DataONE content and statistics.

The PLOS Lagotto system needs particular types of access to DataONE:

* Basic metadata for each dataset: identifier, identifier_type, title, publication_date (year or year-month is fine), member node
* optional additional metadata that describes the relationship between works, e.g. isNewVersion (Iâ€™m using the DataCite relation type categories for this)
* a way to query a DataONE API to give me this information by member node, publication_date and/or update_date. The latter is needed so that I can run a daily cron job that automatically imports new/updated works.

There are several ways to get at all of this information.  DataONE exposes three main sources of information on data sets (SystemMetadata, ScienceMetadata, and ResourceMaps), each of which can be retrieved with an API call if you know the identifier of a data set.  Here are the REST calls needed to get information for an example data set from the KNB member node.

## Example data set from the KNB 

* __Bennington College, and Huron Mt. Wildlife Foundation and Woods K.__ 2014. *Long-term tree demography in old-growth forests of Huron Mts, MI from permanent-plot censuses, 1962-2009* (doi:10.5063/F1PC3085)

* To get SystemMetadata:

{% highlight sh %}
https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/meta/doi:10.5063/F1PC3085
{% endhighlight %}

* To get ScienceMetadata:

{% highlight sh %}
https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/object/doi:10.5063/F1PC3085
{% endhighlight %}

* To get the ResourceMap (which describes the components of a data package): 

{% highlight sh %}
https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/object/urn:uuid:5a721c8b-94b1-4c33-9ab2-d99f963a4215
{% endhighlight %}

DataONE also indexes most the metadata provided in these individual documents in a SOLR index, so you can issue a SOLR query to get most of the info you want for a single document:

{% highlight sh %} https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/query/solr/?fl=id,title,formatId,formatType,documents,resourceMap,obsoletes,obsoletedBy,datePublished,authoritativeMN,replicaMN,dateUploaded,dateModified&q=id:doi\:10.5063/F1PC3085
{% endhighlight %}

And here's the result:

{% highlight xml %}

This information indicates that this object has id `doi:10.5063/F1PC3085`, that it is a new version of the object with id `knb.499.1`, that it is an `EML` metadata document with formatId `eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.1`, and that it is part of the DataPackage that is identified by the resource map id `urn:uuid:5a721c8b-94b1-4c33-9ab2-d99f963a4215`. It also is present in 5 replicas in 5 different data repositories with the listed `replicaMN` node identifiers, which means that DataONE usage statistics would be providing download statistics for this object from these repositories combined.

Of course, because its SOLR, you can also ask for the same info for a range of objects.  For example, the following query gives some metadata for all objects that have had a SystemMetadata modification in the last week.  SystemMetadata gets modified anytime an important event happens to an object, such as an access control change, or if it is obsoleted by a new version, or a new replica is created.

{% highlight sh %} https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/query/solr/?fl=id,title,formatId,formatType,documents,resourceMap,obsoletes,obsoletedBy,datePublished,authoritativeMN,replicaMN,dateUploaded,dateModified&q=dateModified:[NOW-7DAYS/DAY%20TO%20NOW]
{% endhighlight %}

You could add more filter criteria, such as restrict it to only documents on one node (e.g., `datasource:urn\:node\:DRYAD`).

## Getting download statistics for each object:

We also record download stats (and download size) in another SOLR index that I mentioned in previous posts, and which are described in [DataONE Usage Statistics](http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/jenkins/job/API%20Documentation%20-%20trunk/ws/api-documentation/build/html/design/UsageStatistics.html).  For the KNB data set above, you could get monthly download stats using:

{% highlight sh %} https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/query/logsolr/select?q=pid:doi\:10.5063/F1PC3085&fq=event:read&facet=true&facet.range=dateLogged&facet.range.start=2014-01-01T01:01:01Z&facet.range.end=2014-12-31T24:59:59Z&facet.range.gap=%2B1MONTH
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, it's likely you'll want download statistics for each object that has been accessed on a given day.  As an example, just facet by the object identifier and query the for log events from the past week (not including today):

{% highlight sh %} https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/query/logsolr/select?q=event:read+dateLogged:[NOW-7DAYS/DAY%20TO%20NOW]&facet=true&facet.field=pid&facet.mincount=1&facet.limit=-1
{% endhighlight %}

Lagotto will more likely want to query for just a single day to get finer-grained counts, and update its index daily.  Note that this query returns a count for each pid in the time period, and that one will need to step through multiple pages of results by incrementing facet.offset (possibly in pages of 1000), or get all of the results in one page by setting facet.limit=-1.

## Getting download statistics for each Member Node

For the KNB node, you could see monthly download statistics using:

{% highlight sh %}
https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/query/logsolr/select?q=nodeId:urn\:node\:KNB&fq=event:read&facet=true&facet.range=dateLogged&facet.range.start=2000-01-01T01:01:01Z&facet.range.end=2014-12-31T24:59:59Z&facet.range.gap=%2B1MONTH
{% endhighlight %}

And the same stats for Dryad:

{% highlight sh %}
https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/query/logsolr/select?q=nodeId:urn\:node\:DRYAD&fq=event:read&facet=true&facet.range=dateLogged&facet.range.start=2000-01-01T01:01:01Z&facet.range.end=2014-12-31T24:59:59Z&facet.range.gap=%2B1MONTH
{% endhighlight %}

## Getting information about Member Nodes

DataONE returns a Member Node `nodeId` in many data structures, such as `urn:node:KNB`. This is the permanent, unique, and unchanging identifier for the node, but is not particularly human readable.  DataONE also provides a node registry that provides additional metadata about Member Nodes that Lagotto might want to use in user interface displays, such as the node name.  The node registry can be accessed at:

{% highlight sh %}
https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/node
{% endhighlight %}

and produces output like:

## Notes on DataONE Identifiers

DataONE has a [policy on minting persistent identifiers (PIDs)](http://jenkins-1.dataone.org/jenkins/job/API%20Documentation%20-%20trunk/ws/api-documentation/build/html/design/PIDs.html) for data sets.  This policy basically treats identifiers as opaque strings, and simply ensures the identifiers are unique on a first-come first-served basis.  This allows Member Nodes to use the identifiers that they use locally, as long as it follows some basic conventions, including that the identifier is:

* Unique: no other objects share the identifier
* Persistent: the identifier is assigned in perpetuity (even if the data set itself is no longer accessible)
* Consistent: the data bytes returned when accessing an identifier will always be identical (i.e., no revisions)

This all means that generally consumers can expect to get the same objects from an identifier, or none at all, which is critical to reproducibility.  We don't require that providers can return every version of every object, only that if asked for an object with a given identifier, the bytes they return never change.  If someone wants to update an object, they must assign a new identifier and indicate in SystemMetadata that the new identifier `obsoletes` the original identifier.  This creates a reliable version history and citation chain.

Unfortunately, in some communities it is common to change the content that lives behind an identifier (such as a DOI). A DOI typically points at a landing page from which a user might retrieve the actual data of the data set, which at times is modified to fix errors or add data.  This poses many problems for reproducibly citing data sets, as a researcher accessing a data set originally cited as `A` will never know if in fact they received `A'` or `A''` instead, as they all share the same identifier.  DataONE does not allow this for their Persistent Identifiers (PIDs).

As a consequence, some DataONE member nodes must append additional information onto their local identifier when posting to DataONE to ensure that the content is persistent.  A classic example is Dryad, where they assign DOIs to data sets, but then must append a timestamp to that DOI to make a unique PID.  Consequently, the identifiers that Dryad publishes to DataONE will be related to but not necessarily identical to the identifiers they publish on their own site.  For example, the Dryad identifier `doi:10.5061/dryad.82t1k` was published in DataONE as `http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.82t1k/1?ver=2014-02-10T13:01:02.328-05:00`, with an additional version published in DataONE as `http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.82t1k?ver=2014-02-10T13:00:57.913-05:00`.  In addition, the main Dryad DOI represents the metadata file, and they append a suffix to the DOI to create a unique identifier for a data file that comprises a part of the data set (e.g., the data file `http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.82t1k/1/bitstream`). Finally, they use a very similar ID for the related ResourceMap that links the contents of the data package (`http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.82t1k?format=d1rem&ver=2014-02-10T13:00:57.913-05:00`). So, querying DataONE shows four objects that are related to a single Dryad DOI, three of which are different kinds of files, and one of which is a new revision of the metadata file, but seemingly not marked as a new version properly (we'll have to check on that):

{% endhighlight %}

Needless to say, Lagotto will not be able to use simple substring matching to get an accurate portrayal of usage among the various files that constitute a data set in DataONE and match those to Dryad or other repositories.  The information needed to understand the structure,  contents, and versions of a data file is present in DataONE, but the relationships get complex.  They are also dependent upon Member Nodes providing accurate metadata about an object and its version relationships (see the example above from the KNB for one where `obsoletes` properly indicates that one object replaced another).
